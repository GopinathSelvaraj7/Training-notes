    "## Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree algorithm is one of the most versatile algorithms in machine learning which can perform both classification and regression analysis. It is very powerful and works great with complex datasets. Apart from that, it is very easy to understand and read. That makes it more popular to use. When coupled with ensemble techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, this algorithm works by dividing the whole dataset into a tree-like structure based on some rules and conditions and then gives prediction based on those conditions.\n",
    "Let’s understand the approach to decision tree with a basic scenario. \n",
    "Suppose it’s for Income Range of applicant where we have to decide if we should give applicant loan or not. Let the decision tree decide it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"photos/Capture.PNG\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "                         \n",
    "Although we may or may not use the decision tree for such decisions, this was a basic example to help you understand how a decision tree makes a decision.\n",
    "So how did it work?\n",
    "*\tIt selects a root node based on a given condition, e.g. our root node was Income range of Applicant.\n",
    "*\tThen, the root node was split into child notes based on the given condition. The left and right child node in the above figure was again splited on the basis of  'Criminal Records' , after that no more questions were asked.\n",
    "*\tThe middle child node didn’t fulfil the condition, so again it was split based on a new condition.\n",
    "*\tThis process continues till all the conditions are met or if you have predefined the depth of your tree, e.g. the depth of our tree is 4, and it reached there when all the conditions were exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how the parent nodes and condition is chosen for the splitting to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tree Pruning\n",
    "Tree pruning is the method of trimming down a full tree (obtained through the above process) to reduce the complexity and variance in the data. Just as we regularised linear regression, we can also regularise the decision tree model by adding a new term. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"photos/formula3.PNG\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "                                       \n",
    "Where, T  is the subtree which is a subset of the full tree T0\n",
    "And α is the non-negative tuning parameter which penalises the MSE with an increase in tree length.\n",
    "By using cross-validation, such values of α and T are selected for which our model gives the lowest test error rate.\n",
    "This is how the decision tree regression model works. Let’s now see the working algorithm of doing classification using a decision tree.\n",
    "Greedy Algorithm\n",
    "As per Hands-on machine learning book “greedy algorithm greedily searches for an optimum split at the top level, then repeats the process at each level. It does not check whether or not the split will lead to the lowest possible impurity several levels down. A greedy algorithm often produces a reasonably good solution, but it is not guaranteed to be the optimal solution.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Post-pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-pruning, also known as backward pruning, is the process where the decision tree is generated first and then the non-significant branches are removed. Cross-validation set of data is used to check the effect of pruning and tests whether expanding a node will make an improvement or not. If any improvement is there then we continue by expanding that node else if there is reduction in accuracy then the node not be expanded and should be converted in a leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-pruning, also known as forward pruning, stops the non-significant branches from generating. It uses a condition to decide when should it terminate splitting of some of the branches prematurely as the tree is generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression trees are used for quantitative data. In the case of qualitative data or categorical data, we use classification trees.  In regression trees, we split the nodes based on RSS criteria, but in classification, it is done using classification error rate, Gini impurity and entropy.\n",
    "Let’s understand these terms in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entropy\n",
    "Entropy is the measure of randomness in the data. In other words, it gives the impurity present in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"photos/entropy.PNG\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "                                           \n",
    "When we split our nodes into two regions and put different observations in both the regions, the main goal is to reduce the entropy i.e. reduce the randomness in the region and divide our data cleanly than it was in the previous node. If splitting the node doesn’t lead into entropy reduction, we try to split based on a different condition, or we stop. \n",
    "A region is clean (low entropy) when it contains data with the same labels and random if there is a mixture of labels present (high entropy).\n",
    "Let’s suppose there are ‘m’ observations and we need to classify them into categories 1 and 2.\n",
    "Let’s say that category 1 has ‘n’ observations and category 2 has ‘m-n’ observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "p= n/m  and    q = m-n/m = 1-p\n",
    "\n",
    "then, entropy for the given set is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "          E = -p*log2(p) – q*log2(q) \n",
    "           \n",
    "           \n",
    "When all the observations belong to category 1, then p = 1 and all observations belong to category 2, then p =0, int both cases E =0, as there is no randomness in the categories.\n",
    "If half of the observations are in category 1 and another half in category 2, then p =1/2 and q =1/2, and the entropy is maximum, E =1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"photos/entropy1.PNG\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "                                  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Information Gain\n",
    "Information gain calculates the decrease in entropy after splitting a node. It is the difference between entropies before and after the split. The more the information gain, the more entropy is removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"photos/info_gain.PNG\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "                                 \n",
    "Where, T is the parent node before split and X is the split node from T.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree which is splitted on basis of entropy and information gain value looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"photos/entropy_tree.PNG\" width=\"900\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ginni Impurity\n",
    "According to wikipedia, ‘Gini impurity is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly labelled if it was randomly labelled according to the distribution of labels in the subset.’\n",
    "It is calculated by multiplying the probability that a given observation is classified into the correct class and sum of all the probabilities when that particular observation is classified into the wrong class.\n",
    "Let’s suppose there are k number of classes and an observation belongs to the class ‘i’, then Ginni impurity is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"photos/ginni.PNG\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "                                    \n",
    "Ginni impurity value lies between 0 and 1, 0 being no impurity and 1 denoting random distribution.\n",
    "The node for which the Ginni impurity is least is selected as the root node to split.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree which is splitted on basis of ginni impurity value looks like:\n",

    "\n",
    "* Classfication and Regression Algorithm(CART) : It is the most popular algorithm used for constructing decison trees. It uses ginni impurity as the default calculation for selecting root nodes, however one can use \"entropy\" for criteria as well. This algorithm works on both regression as well as classfication problems. We will use this algorithm in our pyhton implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy and Ginni impurity can be used reversibly. It doesn't affects the result much. Although, ginni is easier to compute than entropy, since entropy has a log term calculation. That's why CART algorithm uses ginni as the default algorithm.\n",
